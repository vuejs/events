# Presentations

## Introduction

This is an effort to centralize all public presentations about Vue.js and associated libraries/frameworks. It catalogs presentations by theme and year, and can be used to help speakers find presentations that are open for reuse. So that knowledge can be shared at local events without having to recreate each presentation.
